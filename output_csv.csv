EXAMPLE CO-OP'S (see website for full list)
1. Internship: Optimize the electrostatic particle removal method on the EUV electrostatic wafer clamp
Introduction

This is an internship (co-op) assignment for a bachelor student in Electronics, Physics, or a related field, who has an affinity with the fields of electrostatics and material science

Job Mission

Contamination in ASML machines causes yield problems for our customers. ASML has developed a method to remove particle contamination from the EUV electrostatic wafer clamp. The concept has been proven, but has not yet been optimized.

Job Description

Optimize the electrostatic particle removal method for particle removal effectiveness and duration.

Your tasks will include:
? Getting acquainted with the current knowledge status and way of working at high tech experimental setups.
? Designing a plan to test the impact of selected parameters.
? Performing experiments in a cleanroom environment.
? Reporting and presenting your findings to the ASML electrostatics competence group.
? Assisting in further development by creating and/or testing additional optimization hypotheses.

Education

You are a bachelor student in Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Physics, or a related field and you have an affinity with the fields of electrostatics and material science. You are a critical thinker, and a focused and accurate experimenter.

This is an internship (graduation or apprentice) for 5 days a week with a duration of about 6 months.

Please keep in mind that we can only consider students (who are enrolled at a school during the whole internship period) for our internships and graduation assignments.


2. Internship: Design exploration of the low pressure gas pump
Introduction

This is an internship assignment for a master'sstudent in Mechanical Engineering or Applied Physics, graduating in a field that's compatiblewith fluid dynamics.

Job Mission

ASML is working hard to enable greener technology by enabling smaller and more energy efficient electronics. The latest generation of lithography machines use light in the extreme ultra violet range. Since light of this wavelength (13.5 nm) is absorbed by any optical medium, reflective optics in a vacuum are used. Any dust particle can potentially ruin the light patterns that are generated in the machines. Therefore, high velocity jets of low pressure gas are used to push contamination away from sensitive modules.

This requires relatively large flows (~100's of liters per minute) of clean hydrogen gas for particle and contamination suppression. This gas is currently burned off after it has passed through the system once, meaning that the lithography systems currently aren't very energy efficient. This assignment aims to find a way to at least partially recycle the hydrogen flow. For this we need systems to pump low pressure (~100 Pa) gas.

Job Description

There are scaling laws that can be used to estimate the efficiency of fans and pumps at lower pressure. However, it is unclear if they hold at these low pressures. Therefore we need someone to design, validate and use a test set up to determine the efficiency of various pumps and fans.

Deliverables
?Evaluate which pumping systems could match the requirements.
?Design a test setup to test the pumpingsystems in an existing vacuum vessel.
?Test and validate the setup.
?Determine if any of the pumping systems would suffice for our goals, and document your findings.

You'll be working in close collaboration with experienced architect(s) and designers to bring this project to a successful end.

Education

You are a master's student in Mechanical Engineering or Applied Physics, graduating in a field that's compatible with fluid dynamics. The study has both practical and theoretical aspects, where the focus will be is up to you.
We are looking for someone who asks questions and who is willing to pick up and incorporate new information quickly. We expect you to drive your own project and to prepare planning and test claims (under guidance by your supervisor).

This is an apprentice or graduation internship for 3-5 days a week with a minimum duration of 6 months. The start date can be discussed.

Please keep in mind that we can only consider students (who are enrolled at a school during the whole internship period) for our internships and graduation assignments.

Furthermore, this position requires access to U.S. controlled technology, as defined in the United States Export Administration Regulations. Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such U.S. controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with applicants who are immediately eligible to access U.S. controlled technology.

3. Internship: Quantify the precision of a GigE Time Synchronization method

Introduction

This is an apprentice or graduation internship for Bachelor students in Electronics who would like to dive in the problem of how to derive time information from different available (clock) signals at both the master and the slave and how to measure it by means of automation using Python and a very state-of-the-art oscilloscope.

Job Mission

In many industrial applications its required to have very precise time synchronization between different control nodes. The gigabit ethernet interface (GigE) between them allows to implement time-synchronization protocols like IEEE1588 which apply a two way time transfer method. Channel symmetry is key in such method as well as the local timestamp accuracy that determines the time moments used to come to time corrections at the slave.
Demanding applications require high precision synchronization in the order of nanoseconds. For optical implementations this has shown to be feasible. For electrical implementation using copper 1000BASE-T only very limited research is available. A concept has been studied and prototyped using development boards that potentially would allow to achieve very accurate timings over copper interfaces as well.
 

Job Description
Study in more depth a particular Gigabit Ethernet PHY;
Create a Python script that allows commanding an existing development kit having a gigE chip;
Extend the Python script to allow controlling and reading measurements of a high-end oscilloscope;
Create an automated test environment that allows to measure the timing of Master and Slave in subnanosecond resolution;
Execute multiple test with different cable length.
Document the measurement results and draw conclusions on the achievable precision.
 
Education

You are a HBO bachelor studying electrical engineering or a related discipline. You are eager to dive in the problem of how to derive time information from different available (clock) signals at both the master and the slave and how to measure it by means of automation using python and a very state-of-the-art oscilloscope.

Please keep in mind that we can only consider students (who are enrolled at a school during the whole internship period) for our internships and graduation assignments.

You will be paid $300 per month (exchange rates fluctuate based on current market but this number is represented in approximate USD). This will cover most if not all of your living expenses and is the rate that full-time newly graduated engineers are paid in Tanzania.
 
Co-ops will also have the opportunity to become immersed in Tanzanian culture. Students will have up to 3 weeks time off to explore everything that the country has to offer. Past co-ops have used this time to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, go on safari in the Serengeti, and travel to nearby African countries.

If you have a phone with an unlockable sim card, bring it. Phones don't work on plans like most do in the USA, but rather on a pay-as-you-go system for texting, calling, and data. You can likely find living arrangements, especially with a roommate, for around $200/month per person. You should also be prepared to purchase a tourist visa upon your arrival and then a work permit. If you have a computer, please bring it, as we offer wifi at work.

Sikubora is located in northern Tanzania just outside of Arusha. Arusha is one of Tanzania's largest cities and is very popular with tourist traveling to Mount Kilimanjaro and the national parks for safaris. The national language of Tanzania is Swahili, but English speakers are not uncommon, and English is spoken in the office. Tanzania has a very peaceful culture with a low cost of living. For public transportation, a bus ride from town to the office is under 25 cents.

Former co-op says:
""This opportunity at Sikubora gave me a lot of responsibility. Although it is a small company, it is a big thing to be given the tasks and duties such as talking to investors, remote monitoring..etc. Also being involved in some of the meetings with the technicians was nice. Those meetings and the opportunities to go on installation helped me understand the company and the climate Sikubora was acting in. The projects were interesting and versatile. I really enjoyed the array of knowledge I received from completing projects in finance, computer science and business.""

Around Arusha there are many delicious food options, including a variety of locally grown fruits and vegetables. At the market, you can buy produce and goods for an entire week at a very reasonable price. In general, items bought frequently cost less in Tanzania than in the United States, with the exception of quality electronics and some other specially manufactured goods. There are also plenty of good restaurants and bars around Arusha. A lunch at the restaurant near Sikubora's office might cost between $1 and $3, while local beer is sold at around $2 per half-liter bottle.

Getting around town is also inexpensive. Most people use the ""daladala"", which is a van with seats for 15 people, though more will squeeze in and stand. The daladala goes almost everywhere around town (including to Sikubora in Kisongo) and generally costs around 20 cents per ride. Cars are also used to some degree, and motorcycles excessively. In and around town, there are plenty of activities. You can go shopping in the markets, play sports with local groups, and enjoy a variety of traditions. There are scores of natural and cultural wonders near and outside town, such as waterfalls, reservations, and tribal villages.

At the office, there are many Tanzanians who can help you adapt to life in Arusha. Overall, this part of East Africa is safe, will receive you with open arms, and offers a life-changing experience.",Engineering,Stipend,300,,Full Time (32+ Hours Per Week),College of Engineering,View Targeted Programs,1/31/20 23:59,Resume,NUcareers,Sikubora Ltd,Sikubora Ltd,,http://www.sikubora.com/,,,

We are hiring a Full Stack Software Engineering Co-Op for the Summer of 2019 to contribute to our rapid product development pace.  We work collaboratively to set the technical direction for our SaaS products, developing easy-to-use solutions for our customers.  Our engineers find a deep satisfaction in building things that customers actually need.  We focus on delivering value to customers and understand that this often means delivering code that isn't perfect, but meets customer needs.

* You love learning about new technologies, but understand the value of continuing to use something old if it still does everything you need it to do.
* You care about the long-term maintainability of the codebase and will learn to advocate for refactoring and clean-ups where appropriate.
* You care about work life balance and want your company to care about it to; you'll put in the extra hour when needed but won't let it become a habit.

Additional Skills and Knowledge:
* Currnetly pursuing BS, MS, or Ph.D in Computer Science or related technical discipline

As a group SMBs are responsible for 50% of our GDP and 65% of new jobs. They're the lifeblood of our neighborhoods and help give each of them their unique character.

We're shifting the power back to them - giving them the ability to more easily work together and win together. Since launching in 2014, we now have over 4 million members in over 30,000 communities nationwide and are profitable. Our team has founded numerous successful companies from zero to IPO.

You'll be joining our dev team as a CO-OP Software Engineer. You'll be working closely with product management, design, and engineering to craft great experiences for our users. You'll be contributing to our main application throughout the stack from Javascript to Ruby 2.4 + Rails 5 all the way down to x86 assembly (just kidding on that last one). We use Postgres, Redis, Dynamo, Redshift, and Memcached for storage and we deploy code with AWS. We're looking for someone who wants to work at a startup and be an integral part of our dev team. We won't just leave you in a corner to code all day; you'll be participating in design discussions and arguing (with data!) why we should or shouldn't implement a feature.

Your first day at Alignable:

You'll hop on the T and arrive at our office by North Station between 9:00 and 10:00am. We'll give your new Macbook Pro and help you configure your dev environment. In your first few hours, you'll have your dev environment set up with your favorite editor (which is VIM, naturally) and our CTO and his awesome beard will give you an overview of the product. Around 12, we'll break for lunch.

After lunch, you'll get started on your first JIRA ticket - a production bug chosen specifically to help familiarize you with the codebase. You put on your headphones and start cranking. After several minutes / hours, you have a solution. Your solution includes a unit test that replicates the bug. You push your branch to Github and create a pull request. Within a few minutes, our continuous integration software runs the test suite against your code and one of your insanely awesome fellow engineers will code review your solution. Once your code is reviewed with no outstanding issues and all tests pass, you can merge to master and push your code to production. 

As your co-op progresses, you'll be tasked with larger features with more responsibility. Several months into your co-op, the features you'll be implementing will make you indistinguishable from a full-time junior engineer.

You might want to work here if you: 
- have experience with or willingness to learn Ruby/Javascript
- want to be treated like a regular team member, not as an intern
- like the constructive feedback provided by code reviews
- enjoy the security provided by a comprehensive test suite
- appreciate the delicate balance between writing ""good"" code and shipping
- understand the performance implications of different algorithms and data-structures
- grok Git and can explain: ""Git gets easier once you understand branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space""

No,Backend Software Engineer,Co-op (US Domestic),1,2020 - Spring,6 Month,California-San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,United States,Intermediate to Advanced,"Who We Are

Certain Lending is a Series-A, financial technology startup located in the heart of San Francisco's financial district. Founded in September 2017, we connect real estate investors to competitive financing options and ensure timely access to mortgage capital through an online experience, high-touch client engagement, and institutional-grade advice.

A client may enter their project details into our responsive online platform and we will return a digital comparison of financing offers from bank and non-bank lenders on their behalf, including potentially one from our firm. After clients choose an offer of their liking, we work on their behalf to ensure their transaction closes on time at the desired terms. For loans we directly finance, we then work to sell these mortgages to hedge funds and other firms to hold to maturity. We facilitate projects ranging from a single family residence fix and flip project to the acquisition, renovation, or construction of a hotel or office space. 

Your Co-op Experience

We are seeking a highly motivated, autonomous and accountable individual who is driven to take on real responsibility within a production application. Once you are up to speed with our architecture, you will take the lead on a front-end, back-end, or dev-ops project of your own design.

Certain Lending is a Series-A, financial technology startup located in the heart of San Francisco's financial district. Founded in September 2017, we connect real estate investors to competitive financing options and ensure timely access to mortgage capital through an online experience, high-touch client engagement, and institutional-grade advice.

A client may enter their project details into our responsive online platform and we will return a digital comparison of financing offers from bank and non-bank lenders on their behalf, including potentially one from our firm. After clients choose an offer of their liking, we work on their behalf to ensure their transaction closes on time at the desired terms. For loans we directly finance, we then work to sell these mortgages to hedge funds and other firms to hold to maturity. We facilitate projects ranging from a single family residence fix and flip project to the acquisition, renovation, or construction of a hotel or office space. 

Your Co-op Experience

We are seeking a highly motivated, autonomous and accountable individual who is driven to take on real responsibility within a production application. Once you are up to speed with our architecture, you will take the lead on a front-end, back-end, or dev-ops project of your own design.

Casma Overview
Casma Therapeutics is harnessing the natural cellular process of autophagy to open vast new target areas for drug discovery and development that will profoundly impact the lives of patients. Autophagy is a conserved cellular process that contributes to overall organismal health. Inefficient autophagy flux or defects in lysosomal homeostasis are observed in numerous pathologies, e.g., neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, inflammation, and muscle degeneration. Casma uses several approaches to intervene at strategic points throughout the autophagy-lysosome system to improve the cellular process of clearing out unwanted proteins, organelles and invading pathogens.

Wefunder is like ""Kickstarter for investing"". We've helped fund over 160 startups and small businesses, including flying cars, space rockets, breweries, hollywood studios, and potential Ebola cures. Every company we've funded is full of amazing stories.

We're larger than all of our competitors, are growing like crazy, and need to add reinforcements to our team! It's not all rainbows and bunnies, but hard work and fast paced. However, we'll keep it fun, creative and engaging to keep you on your toes.

Some things you could be doing:
Scouting out cool businesses we can help fund

Telling the story of business owners
Communicate user feedback on our product and ways it can be improved

Skills & Experience
We're more concerned with your drive and hunger than your experience. We invest in potential. If you are a quick learner and super-motivated, we'll help teach you.

Here are some skills we think are important:
Organization and attention to detail. It's important that no balls get dropped when dealing with multiple projects and stakeholders

Strong people skills. You should have a talent for making people feel instantly comfortable, heard, and understood.

Prioritize efficiently. You'll be juggling a thousand things at once. Be able to recognize which tasks are most important and get those done.

Learn quickly. There are tons of details to learn; securities regulations are quite complex and things change fast around here. You must be able to absorb and retain a lot of facts quickly; we don't like answering the same question three times and it's up to you to seek out information if you need it.

Responsible & accountable. If you say you will do it, you do it.

Compensation
We'll start out at $20/hr. We're also happy to teach and mentor. Give us your best, and we'll give you our best.

About Wefunder
On May 16, 2016, it became legal for regular people to invest as little as $100 in startups and small businesses. Since then, we have become the largest equity crowdfunding platform. We've helped 190+ startups and small businesses ? including flying cars, space rockets, breweries, Hollywood studios, and potential Ebola cures ? raise $70 million.

We're a Public Benefit Corporation and a B Corp with a mission to revitalize capitalism and keep the American dream alive. GDP growth is slowing. Wealth inequality is increasing. Entrepreneurship is dying across America; falling from 10.6% to 3.6% among those under 30 since 1989. We're reversing these trends by funding more deserving businesses across all of America, not solely tech startups in Silicon Valley.

Or whether while you are watching TV, your TV is watching you? We are conducting a wide range of privacy-related investigations in a ""living lab"" of IoT devices housed in the Mon(IoT)r lab in ISEC, which is set up like a studio apartment complete with large numbers of IoT devices, including TVs, fridges, washer/dryer, smart speakers, and smart thermostats. The goal of our project is to investigate IoT privacy leaks from devices in our lab and ultimately: (i) make users aware of what personal information is shared by their IoT devices, and (ii) give them control over which personal information can be shared and to whom. For example, if a user's Internet-connected camera does not use an encrypted connection to exchange credentials, the user should be warned that the credentials have been leaked and that anyone with an Internet connection can potentially get access to them.

The Research Assistant (RA) will work closely with Prof. Choffnes, his postdoc, and his Ph.D. students to build measurement- and traffic-modifying tools that detect and block privacy leaks from IoT devices in the Mon(IoT)r lab. The RA will have access to more than 100 devices not only in our lab in Boston, but also in our partner labs in London and Torino. This position is in a unique research environment, where the RA will work on new and interesting problems and advance the state of the art. Unlike many positions in industry, we publicize the results of our research and make our software products freely available publicly along with source code. Recent co-ops have produced results that led to vulnerability disclosures, bug bounties, publications in research conferences (along with paid trips to attend and present their work), and international press coverage.

No response,Program Correctness and Game Development Co-op,Co-op (US Domestic),1,2020 - Spring,6 Month,Massachusetts-Boston,Boston,MA,United States,Suited to All Levels,"The goal of this project is to turn proving program correctness into a compelling game that computer science majors (and the general public) want to play. This is an emerging area of research with the potential to be a game-changing approach to dealing with the challenge of software verification. Society is crucially dependent on software, which is used to control critical infrastructure, medical devices, power plants, trains, automobiles, planes, stock markets and sensitive data such as medical and financial records. Bugs in software have lead to deaths, the loss of massive amounts of money and numerous security vulnerabilities. Traditionally software verification requires highly trained formal methods experts and our goal is to develop engaging games that allow non-experts to reason about software.

The current state of the art only allows players to come up with program invariants for very simple programs; we want players to come up with invariants for more complex programs. More generally, we want to develop a game that provides counterexamples, allows multiple players to work together, and allows players more specialized roles and has support for hierarchy and decomposing problems into smaller, more manageable components.

One major assumption that most existing games have made in that code should be hidden from players. Recent work from our group has questioned this assumption, and we developed a game, IDG, that does show players code. Our experimental evaluation shows that players of IDG discover higher quality invariants that prove more programs correct than players of previous games. Our game supports richer human-computer interactions, leading to effective human-in-the-loop systems that are able to augment the ability of non-experts to find loop invariants. See below for a link to the paper.

For this project, we want to explore the following interesting question: how far we can get without showing code (for example, by showing execution traces and counterexamples), which may be a balanced approach that is both effective and engaging to players. Part of the motivation comes from our experience with IDG; while the game is a significant improvement over previous approaches, the attrition rate in the population that played it was higher than trace-based games. So, a natural question is whether we can take the lessons learned and the technology we developed to design a more engaging game.

We are using ACL2s (covered in CS2800) and JavaScript to develop a web game. We expect that working on the project will involve work on web game development, systems programming in ACL2s/Lisp, Linux server development and databases, running experiments, analyzing data, and writing a report for publication.

You can try the game here: http://invgame.atwalter.com/.

You can read the paper comparing the code and no-code versions of the game here: Gamification of Loop-Invariant Discovery from Code.

Snippet from two former co-ops:
""Working at the MBTA has been a fantastic introduction into the public sector, and has allowed me to work on problems that have a direct impact on the T. This position has exposed me to data in various forms (records in a database, data frames, spreadsheets, etc.), and has given me a new-found appreciation for the amount of data we encounter daily that is not so apparent. I have done something different almost every week here which has pushed me a little bit outside of my comfort zone, but as a consequence, it has also exposed me to many different types of work that I thought I would never try.""
 
""I spent 80% of my time learning to wrangle, present, interpret, and analyze data using both Excel and R, with the opportunity to learn Python. Having come from a non-technical background, I'm very satisfied with how much I was able to learn in the short timeframe. The co-op lead was incredibly helpful and clearly passionate about teaching the co-ops both specific technical skills and broader philosophical questions in data analytics.""

I worked with pretty much every office in the building and got a huge breadth of experiences, from more hands-on activities like doing box intake for the SRC to more detail-heavy work like creating an inventory of 12,000 documents. This position requires a lot of independence, a strong attention to details, and a willingness to learn and adapt quickly. The people you work with are extremely intelligent, kind, and helpful. Between learning how to use multiple database systems, preserving decaying documents, and exploring the vaults, 6 months flew past. I would recommend this position to second-cycle students who are interested in government and history, are particularly keen on the details, and have drive to finish long-term projects.

No response,Research Opportunity,Co-op (US Domestic),1,2020 - Spring,6 Month,Massachusetts-Boston,Charlestown,MA,United States,Suited to All Levels,"Job opening: Image reconstruction and data analytics
 
Job description and requirement:
We have multiple ongoing projects that require raw data manipulation, image handling, and image reconstruction for nuclear medicine and molecular imaging applications. This opening requires knowledge in mathematics and programming in MATLAB, and C++. Note that GPU programing, machine learning, and/or physics computer modeling is a huge plus. Experience in optics in general or laser optics in particular is extra.
 
Learning outcome: Students will gain knowledge about nuclear medicine imaging modalities and system design and will have chance to experiment with fundamental and high-end detector components of PET, and SPECT systems. They will also learn how to design an experiment or simulation, write manuscripts and research proposals.

Length of the project: Some of the projects span over multiple years which require simulations and modeling in different stages. Short-term and long-term contributions are possible. If the student contributes to the project, his/her name will be added to the research paper(s) even if his/her time in the lab is finished and the project keeps ongoing.

Mentoring: The PI and current lab members will be helping the student to accomplish his/her work. Lab meetings and one-to-one meeting between the PI and the student will be held. But the PI's door is always open for any questions or concerns.


Lab description:
In Sabet-lab for radiation physics and instrumentation, we focus on developing high-performance and advanced radiation imaging systems by rigorously studying and addressing fundamental limitations of today's imaging systems. One specific research area in our lab is fabrication of new category of radiation detectors using ultra short laser pulses for Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Computed Tomography (CT) applications, and intraoperative nuclear probes. We developed Laser-Induced Optical Barriers (LIOB) technique where a high-power pulsed laser is tightly focused inside the bulk of a radiation scintillator crystal, causing a local modification of the crystal structure. The modification is manifested by a change in refractive index (RI) of the material, where the modified region (called Optical Barrier) will have a RI lower than that of the unmodified crystal. Using the LIOB technique we place a pattern of optical barriers to manipulate scintillation light spread inside the radiation detector to achieve high spatial resolution radiation detector and hence improve the medical image quality.
 
Ongoing projects related to this job opening:
Developing light transport software for nuclear medical imaging applications
Image reconstruction for cardiac-specific SPECT system
Image reconstruction for brain-dedicated PET system
Image registration and reconstruction for intra-operative positron-gamma probe for surgical applications
These multidisciplinary projects span over medical and nuclear physics, engineering, mathematics, computer modeling, and material science.

Working at Ashoka Indonesia
My experience at Ashoka Indonesia was really great!  While I was there, I worked mainly on a GlobalizerX program, in which five Ashoka Indonesia social entrepreneurs (we call them Fellows) spent 5 months learning how to scale up their impact without scaling up their infrastructure.  I oversaw groups of consultants from A.T. Kearney, PwC and other companies who helped the social entrepreneurs with their strategies.  In addition, there was a three-day summit for the program in November that we started planning in August.  We developed everything from finding the venue, the agenda/content for each day and invitations for the public for one of our days.  I also helped coordinate the logistics for three other events throughout my 6 months and worked on strategizing Ashoka Indonesia's social media. I think the work will depend on what events/projects are coming up ? however, don't worry because the branch had a TON of ideas right before I left.
 
After a couple years of hiatus, the Ashoka Indonesia branch resolved to rebuild their presence in the country.  Therefore, in 2018, many new people were hired and more events were organized for 2018. When I joined, I was immediately given similar responsibilities as the other full-time staff.  Together, we identified challenges of putting the Ashoka name into the public sphere and rebranding ourselves.  My co-workers were definitely a highlight of my time there.
Some other events I helped coordinate and attended were: interviews for potential new Ashoka Indonesia Fellows; an event with A.T. Kearney where consultants helped Ashoka Indonesia Fellows find solutions to common problems they encountered (not necessarily just scaling up impact); a breakfast with senior-level businesspeople to introduce them to social entrepreneurship and Ashoka Indonesia, and form possible partnerships; and an Ashoka Global Partnership retreat in Indonesia where Ashoka staff from various worldwide branches from the partnership teams joined together to discuss strategies, develop collaborations and bond with each other.
 
What I learned from co-oping at Ashoka Indonesia 
This was my second co-op, and I definitely think I grew a lot, not just in a professional sense, but also just for myself. One of the best things to consider for this co-op is your ability to take initiative.  The work on my part was pretty project-based, so my manager did not tell me exactly what I needed to accomplish day-to-day.  This meant I had to create my own schedule and tasks to achieve my long-term goals.  The work is extremely rewarding, and you are constantly surrounded by inspiring and kind people (both my co-workers and the social entrepreneurs).If you are interested in social entrepreneurship, this co-op is excellent and provides great insight into the field.  However, I also think the skills you gain (time management, project management, leadership, professional communication, global communication) are highly transferrable.
 
Living in Indonesia
Living in Indonesia is nice.  I didn't make too many friends besides my co-workers, but I'm sure there are many expat events in Jakarta if you put yourself out there.  In addition, all my co-workers could speak English very well, so there was no need to really learn Indonesian fluently. Obviously, if you can, that's more advantageous because the average Indonesian doesn't speak English very well. I was the only co-op in Jakarta as far as I know, but there were some in Bali I think. I heard that Ashoka Indonesia may hire 2 co-ops, which would be awesome. During the weekends, I explored Jakarta (it's a HUGE city) and also was able to travel around Indonesia a little.
 
Living in Indonesia is SO cheap compared to the US.  I bought food for lunch every day and it was around $2-3 USD.  I was awarded some money from the Presidential Global Scholarship, which went a long way, so definitely apply for that.  For housing, I lived in Menteng, which is in central Jakarta.  There were a lot of food, convenience stores and public transportation stops nearby, so I could get anywhere in Jakarta pretty easily. If the Ashoka Indonesia office is still in East Jakarta, the commute will be a little long (about 1.25 hr), so it depends on your priorities!  Also Menteng is a little expensive (for Indonesian standards) because it is center city. I just stayed in an AirBnb for 6 months, but there are certainly much cheaper alternatives. Ask your co workers for help, they are so friendly and kind.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do ? you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) 

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool.

No response,Research Opportunity,Co-op (US Domestic),1,2020 - Spring,6 Month,Massachusetts-Boston,Charlestown,MA,United States,Suited to All Levels,"Job opening: CAD drawing and opto-mechanical engineering
 
Job description and requirement:
We have multiple ongoing projects that require mechanical drawings, mechanical design calculations, 3D printing and communication with machine shops for manufacturing of parts for different experiments. This opening thus requires mechanical engineering skills and proficiency with mechanical drawing software such as SOLIDWORKS, AUTODESK, etc. Given the broad scope of our work and the number of ongoing projects in our lab we further see that the candidate has an open mind and enthusiasm for taking on various different tasks as needed. Additional experience in optics in general or laser optics in particular is extra.
 
Learning outcome: Students will gain knowledge about nuclear medicine imaging modalities and system design and will have chance to experiment with fundamental and high-end detector components of PET, and SPECT systems. They will also learn how to design an experiment or simulation, write manuscripts and research proposals.

Length of the project: Some of the projects span over multiple years which require simulations and modeling in different stages. Short-term and long-term contributions are possible. If the student contributes to the project, his/her name will be added to the research paper(s).

Mentoring: The PI and current lab members will be helping the student to accomplish his/her work. Lab meetings and one-to-one meeting between the PI and the student will be held. But the PI's door is always open for any questions or concerns.

Lab description:
In Sabet-Lab for radiation physics and instrumentation, we focus on developing high-performance and advanced radiation imaging systems by rigorously studying and addressing fundamental limitations of today's imaging systems. One specific research area in our lab is fabrication of new category of radiation detectors using ultra short laser pulses for Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Computed Tomography (CT) applications, and intraoperative nuclear probes. We developed Laser-Induced Optical Barriers (LIOB) technique where a high-power pulsed laser is tightly focused inside the bulk of a radiation scintillator crystal, causing a local modification of the crystal structure. The modification is manifested by a change in refractive index (RI) of the material, where the modified region (called Optical Barrier) will have a RI lower than that of the unmodified crystal. Using the LIOB technique we place a pattern of optical barriers to manipulate scintillation light spread inside the radiation detector to achieve high spatial resolution radiation detector and hence improve the medical image quality.
 
Ongoing projects related to this job opening:
Development of a cardiac-specific SPECT system
Development of a brain-dedicated PET system
Development of an intra-operative positron-gamma probe for surgical applications
These multidisciplinary projects span over medical and nuclear physics, engineering, mathematics, computer modeling, and material science.

Students interested in applying to COE global positions must contact Sally Conant (s.conant@northeastern.edu). Once you have spoken with her about the position, your resume will be sent to global employers.

This position is unpaid but the Institute of Atmospheric Pollution Research provides Housing inside the research institute.

CNR IIA  (National Research Council, Institute on Atmospheric Pollution Research)

Position Description:
As a consequence of population growth and urbanization, the transportation demand is steadily rising in the metropolises worldwide. The extensive routine traffic volumes bring pressures to existing urban traffic infrastructure, resulting in everyday traffic congestions. Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) aims for reducing potential congestions in saturated road networks, by adjusting the signal timing according to real-time traffic dynamics.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, and deep neural networks further enhance its learning power. However, centralized RL -that can be formulated under the ""classical"" framework of Markov decision process (MDP)- is infeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by distributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new challenges: now the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint of each local agent due to limited communication among agents.

The purpose of this task is to apply the most advanced techniques available in MARL to properly manage traffic controls in order to improve the traffic conditions in the city of Palermo.

The ideal candidate should have the following skills:
-A basic knowledge of software's to simulate urban mobility (SUMO)
-Good knowledge of Reinforcement Learning techniques
-Some experience with Recurrent Neural Networks (ex. Long-Short Term Memory Networks)
-Advanced coding abilities (C++, Python)
-Some experience with deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Thorch (Pythorch).

The current development model establishing the uncontrolled use of non-renewable sources generates strong pressures on the ecosystem, creating social inequalities and influences on the political stability of many countries. In order to react to these changes it is necessary to develop a new less expensive production and consumption energy systems, able to reduce environmental impact and waste generation.

The need for a transition based on the use of renewables and low environmental impact technologies is particularly important in rural areas where the deterioration of environmental resources is an important issue; in such contexts the potentiality for improvements are very important, considering the existing low-productivity index especially in poorer areas.

This necessary transition can be achieved with better management of energy and natural resources, especially through the production of energy based on biomass and the residues of agricultural production. In fact, among the various sources of energy, the sustainable use of forestry origin biomass together with agriculture and animal waste are a very high energetic and technological potential resources. The benefits the use of bioenergy can provide cover not only the environment, but also the economic and social structure that benefits from a reduction in production costs and in waste disposal costs.

The research activities of the CNR-IIA bioenergies group are focused on the design and development of technologies with reduced environmental impact and on the transfer of knowledge to the rural world.

In detail, the group focuses its activities on:
Development of innovative prototypes for the energetic exploitation of the biomass
Development of innovative biogas purification systems
Environmental analysis of production of energy from biomass with Life Cycle Assessment methodology (LCA)
Analysis of of environmental impacts connected to energy production
Artificial Intelligence for environmental application
Majors considered:
Engineering

The modern built environment is penetrated by networks of increasing size and complexity. From infrastructure systems like electricity, roads and water to social and economic networks, the organized complexity of the city provides it a remarkable degree of resilience to damage. Except when it doesn't. Researchers have been struggling to understand why some disasters or attacks cause only minor repercussions, while others are catastrophic.
 
Until now, this has largely been determined through theoretical modeling or small case studies. However, in recent years new and detailed data streams have become available which permit close observation of failure and recovery processes in multiple networks simultaneously. This opens the door for a new era in resilience research, where the insights of network science can be combined with large scale observations in order to understand, and ultimately improve the resilience of our society.
 
We are looking for talented and motivated students who are interested in collecting, analyzing and modeling data on failures and recovery in infrastructure and social systems including power grids, transportation networks, medical data and more, all with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of what makes our society resilient, and how it can be made better.

Silicon Valley tells you that every startup is changing the world. Have you ever wanted to work on something that actually does?

We help people reverse and prevent lifestyle diseases like type 2 diabetes. This means if someone is living with type 2 ? we can actually reverse the effects of it. That means no more drugs, amputations, blindness, or dialysis. It changes the entire course of people's lives and that is no hyperbole.

OurPath is a digital lifestyle change programme aiming to tackle the growing lifestyle disease epidemic. Combining behavioural science, live mentor support, educational content, and health tech, the programme delivers a holistic approach to sustainably changing people's behaviours and improving their health long-term all via a mobile and web app!

What you'll be working on
Engineering at OurPath doesn't exist in a vacuum. In this role, you'll be working alongside a small team of crack engineers, designers and dieticians to build the best behavioural change programme in the world.

The features you craft will be delivered to users each day and you, along with the rest of the engineering team, will be tasked with making sure these features provide the best possible results and experience for our users!

Our core product is a React Native app and this is where the majority of our users interact with OurPath. We release multiple times a week through CodePush, so the ability to build features iteratively is really important to us.

The app is supported by a Node.js server and MongoDB server which you will be adding new endpoints to as well as enhancing the existing codebase. Our continuous integration setup means we deploy our web code every time a pull request is merged.

OurPath subscribers receive 3G scales and a wrist-worn activity tracker, as well as a nutritional handbook and recipe book. The tech syncs to the OurPath mobile or web app so users can track their progress and the programme takes them through both nutritional and exercise-related lifestyle changes also providing advice on sleep, stress management, thought patterns and behaviours. Users are guided by a professionally accredited dietitian, who checks in every day to keep them on track and accountable. They also have the support of a peer group that they can interact with via the app.

We are a team of ex-strategy consultants in our late 20s and are incredibly passionate about solving the type 2 diabetes epidemic. We believe OurPath is a fun place to work with an informal, non-bureaucratic, and agile working environment. You'll also have a nice amount of autonomy over your work-life balance.

No,Software Engineer,Co-op (US Domestic),1,2020 - Spring,6 Month,Massachusetts,Concord,MA,United States,Suited to All Levels,"Radial Analytics is a software technology startup that develops decision science solutions for healthcare. Our flagship product, Smart Placement, provides real-time optimization of discharge decision making, identifying which patients could and should safely go home with home health services after a hospital stay. 
 
What We Do
With our nation moving rapidly to implement fee-for-value (health care reform), our solutions help hospitals and health systems deliver care more efficiently while simultaneously improving patient outcomes -- delivering data-driven insights that help clinical care teams make better decisions for patients in real time. We capture huge volumes of data - including actual patient outcomes, real time patient data collected in the hospital, and provider quality metrics - and process this data to help doctors, nurses, and physical therapists make better decisions on a patient-individualized basis.
 
Who We Are
At Radial Analytics, innovation is ""in the water"" and ideas trump egos.
We are a small team (~10 employees) that pushes the envelope on new ideas and approaches. We think differently to develop creative solutions to problems. We distill complex ideas and data into simple, easily digestible, highly usable forms. We are fast to deploy, fast to test, and fast to fail. We value action over inaction. We believe that the best ideas and solutions are developed through open collaboration. We evaluate ideas for their inherent worth, making no distinction as to their origin. By working together we challenge each other and make each other better. We value the highest integrity in our relationships, our data processing, and our software design.
 
Our tech stack includes a Python / Django backend, ReactJS frontend, PostgreSQL databases, AWS cloud infrastructure, and modern Python-based data science toolsets: including Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NLTK, etc. We practice agile software development with two-week sprints.
 
Who YOU Are
You have a passion for developing products that positively impact lives.
You have a technical foundation in computer science, data science, design, and/or analytics.
You like big data and you cannot lie.
You've had some exposure to Python or ReactJS, and maybe you've played with Pandas (a big bonus!).
You are smart, thoughtful, and curious; you are a lifelong learner who is highly motivated to solve big problems.
You understand that when it comes to writing code, the best solutions are simple and elegant.
Healthcare knowledge is a plus.
You love puzzles (love of Legos is an added bonus!)
What You'll Do
As a co-op you will be a full-fledged member of our R&D team. Because we're a small team with plenty of work to do, you'll have the unique opportunity to contribute in a wide variety of ways throughout your co-op based on your skills and interests. Previous co-ops over the past two years have written production code in Python and/or ReactJS, implemented new product features, developed new data analysis algorithms and visualizations, built new data pipelines, performed custom deep-dive data analysis for our customers, redesigned our company website, improved the product user interface, and developed new devops infrastructure. You'll be stretched and will learn a lot, and will be given the mentorship and support you need to succeed.
 
Other Important Stuff
Our office is located at 50 Beharrell Street in Concord, MA, a short walk from the MBTA West Concord commuter rail stop (https://www.mbta.com/schedules/CR-Fitchburg/line). We'll cover 50% of your monthly commuter rail pass.
Our morning standup starts at 9:35am every day.
We're a laid-back group with a casual dress code and a modern, open-concept office.
We're a Mac shop.
We play with Legos.

Students interested in applying to COE global positions, please set up an online appointment through myNEU with Sally Conant (s.conant@northeastern.edu). Students attend this informational meeting to learn more about COE global co-op, and following your resume can be forwarded to COE global employers.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Are you interested in real-world solutions to pressing global issues such as climate change, food security, and environmental justice? Do you crave experiences outside the norm that push you to think differently? Are you ready to become a part of something bigger? If so, join us at VerdEnergia Pacifica, a multicultural permaculture community and agroforestry project in the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest, on your next co-op! This co-op position takes students out of the theoretics of the classroom and puts them into hands-on learning scenarios that incorporate principles of permaculture, agroforestry, and regenerative economics. Together, we are envisioning a brighter, greener future, and we invite you to be a part of it.

VerdEnergia was founded in 2006 by a small group of initial investors with the intention of building a cooperative farm in order to secure a healthy future for ourselves and our families.  A green oasis situated in one of the most heavily deforested parts of Costa Rica, the Verde team has worked hard over the years to reforest while simultaneously developing the land into a food forest that could sustain our community. Since then, we have transformed into an education center where people from all over the globe can come to exchange ideas, experience living in an intentional community, and learn about agroforestry and permaculture in a place that is creating a community-based, regenerative economic model with permaculture principles acting as our guide and unifying tool. We combine theory with applied practice, enabling ourselves and others to find right livelihood through practicing permaculture. Our humble project has since expanded into the founding of another business focused on reforesting our watershed, Blacksheep Regenerative Resource Management (https://www.weareblacksheep.org/). Our co-op offers the opportunity for students to work with this budding international business, with the potential for further education, internships, and even employment opportunities. 

This co-op is for those interested in experiencing theory in action, living in a community, and engaging with sustainability projects in a hands-on and dynamic environment. Students will work closely throughout the program with our on-site permaculture experts and support staff on projects ranging from natural building and construction to planting, harvesting, reforestation, hospitality and more. In addition to daily chores expected of every intern, co-op students in the Content Journalism Program have a concentration on documenting daily life of farm staff and interns, the surrounding jungle and its wildlife, agroforestry initiatives, and more through their writing and other modes of creation. These students will be expected to create written content for the VerdEnergia blog, with the potential to work on other projects that require writing and editing expertise. These students will have the opportunity to work with a professional writing staff. Other opportunities may include social media marketing, content editing, or business and legal writing. This experience can be shaped by the interests of the student, but with prompts, guidance, feedback and quotas given by farm marketing staff. Journalism, Marketing, or Writing students can learn about content creation and apply it to an active business model, gain professional writing experience, and are expected to put together a portfolio of their work at the end of their stay. This is a unique position that is truly crafted and flavored by each individual student. Because of this, the ideal candidate for this opportunity is self-motivated, interested, open-minded, creative and responsible.

Not only do students participate in experiential learning opportunities throughout the course of their co-op by working with Steve, they will also be formally trained in permaculture design while studying under other permaculture and agroforestry experts through the permaculture design course. The permaculture design course, or PDC, is a 21-day intensive immersion course exploring the theories outlined in Bill Mollison's Permaculture: A Designer's Manual in both hands-on and classroom settings. The curriculum covers regenerative practices as well as design theory and the basics of design consultation on a professional level. Our well-rounded permaculture courses cover the many facets of permaculture and focus on practical solutions in agriculture, building and design, economics, social sciences and politics. Additionally, students will engage with other participants and community members from all over the globe, and will have the opportunity to learn about other projects going on both in Costa Rica, the United States, and beyond.

For a co-op intern, daily life at VerdEnergia is dynamic and dependent on the season. Please keep in mind that experiences vary due to season and length of stay.

Our co-op program is 6 months long total, with 5 months onsite and 1 month of remote work you can do anywhere with an internet connection.

SPRING SEMESTER
Jan 6 - June 25th, 2020 (total program - remote and onsite)
Jan 14 - June 2, 2020 (onsite portion of program)
During the Spring semester, seasons shift from dry season to growing season. Students will get to participate in VerdEnergia's shift of focus from hospitality, harvesting and construction to planting, pruning and field maintenance.

SUMMER/FALL SEMESTER
July 1 - December 23, 2020 (total program - remote and onsite)
July 14 - December 1, 2020 (onsite portion of program)
The Summer/Fall semester is a time of quiet abundance. Seasons shift from veranito (""Little summer"") to full-on rainy season in September and October. Expect peaceful rain, tree planting, garden nurturing, field maintenance and pruning, construction, and harvesting our year's work.

Of course, there is some crossover of work between the seasons; these descriptions give a general idea to help you plan your visit. Food processing, hospitality, and maintenance are a part of community living at VerdEnergia.  Please be prepared to engage in wherever the community needs help.

During time off you can go for a swim in our river, pool, or waterfall, walk jungle trails, enjoy the views from one of our beautiful vistas, do yoga or dance in our studio, make art, play music, check out a local soccer game, or simply relax in a hammock with a good book from our community library.

Communal living is integral to our daily operations. Participants should be comfortable living and working together as well as contributing to farm upkeep. As a community, we wake up together, eat meals together, take turns cooking and cleaning up, and share in the responsibilities of keeping daily operations running smoothly. Each member of farm staff has a different job and responsibilities, but we all do our best to work together as a cohesive group.

While on co-op at VerdEnergia, students will be living on the farm full-time and thus do not need to search for housing or transportation for the duration of the program. As students live, eat, and work on the farm, we ask them to pay for their cost of living.The price is $5600 per semester. This money goes towards the students' certification in permaculture course, food, housing, water and electricity bills, facilities maintenance, and to pay our staff that help make this opportunity possible. We are happy to discuss any questions regarding our pricing model.

If interested in this opportunity, please read more about our project on our website, https://www.verdenergia.org/.

Company Overview
 
At Vicarious Surgical, we are building the next-generation surgical robot. We combine Virtual Reality and human-like robotics to enhance the abilities of surgeons. Through our innovative technology, we have achieved what has been the goal of surgical robotics since the field's inception; to shrink the surgeon and put them inside the patient.
 
Team Focus
 
The Software team handles everything between our custom circuit boards and the user. We develop the backend software that is responsible for converting human motion to robot motion, as well as the VR user interface that surgeons use to drive our robot. We also cover ancillary needs of the company as a whole, such as data logging and test / calibration tools.
 
Project Work
 
We are looking to hire talented software developers to work on our small engineering team to build the software that runs our robot. You will work closely with the embedded team to interface cleanly with our custom hardware, as well as the integration team to get your code running smoothly on our system. There are many options available, depending on your interest and skill set:
Developing robotics algorithms in C
Tackling our vision system and data pipeline end-to-end
Writing our factory calibration and test suite in Python and JS
Implementing low-level real time code on embedded systems
Improving our infrastructure, including build & release, deployment, and overall development workflow
 
What you'll get from us
 
You'll be a contributing member of our team working on the core code base, not an isolated project. You'll learn how to build software collaboratively on a team. Sometimes you'll have to dive in to electrical or mechanical problems, ultimately, you'll get to see your software controlling real hardware.
