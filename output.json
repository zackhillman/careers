As a group SMBs are responsible for 50% of our GDP and 65% of new jobs. They're the lifeblood of our neighborhoods and help give each of them their unique character.\n\nWe're shifting the power back to them - giving them the ability to more easily work together and win together. Since launching in 2014, we now have over 4 million members in over 30,000 communities nationwide and are profitable. Our team has founded numerous successful companies from zero to IPO.\n\nYou'll be joining our dev team as a CO-OP Software Engineer. You'll be working closely with product management, design, and engineering to craft great experiences for our users. You'll be contributing to our main application throughout the stack from Javascript to Ruby 2.4 + Rails 5 all the way down to x86 assembly (just kidding on that last one). We use Postgres, Redis, Dynamo, Redshift, and Memcached for storage and we deploy code with AWS. We're looking for someone who wants to work at a startup and be an integral part of our dev team.

We'll give your new Macbook Pro and help you configure your dev environment. In your first few hours, you'll have your dev environment set up with your favorite editor (which is VIM, naturally) and our CTO and his awesome beard will give you an overview of the product. Around 12, we'll break for lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, you'll get started on your first JIRA ticket - a production bug chosen specifically to help familiarize you with the codebase. You put on your headphones and start cranking. After several minutes / hours, you have a solution. Your solution includes a unit test that replicates the bug. You push your branch to Github and create a pull request. Within a few minutes, our continuous integration software runs the test suite against your code and one of your insanely awesome fellow engineers will code review your solution. Once your code is reviewed with no outstanding issues and all tests pass, you can merge to master and push your code to production. \n\nAs your co-op progresses, you'll be tasked with larger features with more responsibility.

Kearney, PwC and other companies who helped the social entrepreneurs with their strategies.  In addition, there was a three-day summit for the program in November that we started planning in August.  We developed everything from finding the venue, the agenda/content for each day and invitations for the public for one of our days.  I also helped coordinate the logistics for three other events throughout my 6 months and worked on strategizing Ashoka Indonesia's social media. I think the work will depend on what events/projects are coming up ? however, don't worry because the branch had a TON of ideas right before I left.\n \nAfter a couple years of hiatus, the Ashoka Indonesia branch resolved to rebuild their presence in the country.  Therefore, in 2018, many new people were hired and more events were organized for 2018. When I joined, I was immediately given similar responsibilities as the other full-time staff.  Together, we identified challenges of putting the Ashoka name into the public sphere and rebranding ourselves.  My co-workers were definitely a highlight of my time there.\nSome other events I helped coordinate and attended were: interviews for potential new Ashoka Indonesia Fellows; an event with A.T. Kearney where consultants helped Ashoka Indonesia Fellows find solutions to common problems they encountered (not necessarily just scaling up impact); a breakfast with senior-level businesspeople to introduce them to social entrepreneurship and Ashoka Indonesia, and form possible partnerships; and an Ashoka Global Partnership retreat in Indonesia where Ashoka staff from various worldwide branches from the partnership teams joined together to discuss strategies, develop collaborations and bond with each other.\n \nWhat I learned from co-oping at Ashoka Indonesia \nThis was my second co-op, and I definitely think I grew a lot, not just in a professional sense, but also just for myself. One of the best things to consider for this co-op is your ability to take initiative.  The work on my part was pretty project-based, so my manager did not tell me exactly what I needed to accomplish day-to-day.  This meant I had to create my own schedule and tasks to achieve my long-term goals.  The work is extremely rewarding, and you are constantly surrounded by inspiring and kind people (both my co-workers and the social entrepreneurs).If you are interested in social entrepreneurship, this co-op is excellent and provides great insight into the field.  However, I also think the skills you gain (time management, project management, leadership, professional communication, global communication) are highly transferrable.\n \nLiving in Indonesia\nLiving in Indonesia is nice.  I didn't make too many friends besides my co-workers, but I'm sure there are many expat events in Jakarta if you put yourself out there.  In addition, all my co-workers could speak English very well, so there was no need to really learn Indonesian fluently. Obviously, if you can, that's more advantageous because the average Indonesian doesn't speak English very well. I was the only co-op in Jakarta as far as I know, but there were some in Bali I think. I heard that Ashoka Indonesia may hire 2 co-ops, which would be awesome. During the weekends, I explored Jakarta (it's a HUGE city) and also was able to travel around Indonesia a little.\n \nLiving in Indonesia is SO cheap compared to the US.  I bought food for lunch every day and it was around $2-3 USD.  I was awarded some money from the Presidential Global Scholarship, which went a long way, so definitely apply for that.  For housing, I lived in Menteng, which is in central Jakarta.  There were a lot of food, convenience stores and public transportation stops nearby, so I could get anywhere in Jakarta pretty easily. If the Ashoka Indonesia office is still in East Jakarta, the commute will be a little long (about 1.25 hr), so it depends on your priorities!  Also Menteng is a little expensive (for Indonesian standards) because it is center city. I just stayed in an AirBnb for 6 months, but there are certainly much cheaper alternatives. Ask your co workers for help, they are so friendly and kind. \n\n\nCurretn work address in bandung\nWangsa Jelita\nJl. Kelapa Hibrida 4 Blok BD2 No.6, RT.7/RW.13, Pd. Klp., Kec.

Internship: Optimize the electrostatic particle removal method on the EUV electrostatic wafer clamp\nIntroduction\n\nThis is an internship (co-op) assignment for a bachelor student in Electronics, Physics, or a related field, who has an affinity with the fields of electrostatics and material science\n\nJob Mission\n\nContamination in ASML machines causes yield problems for our customers. ASML has developed a method to remove particle contamination from the EUV electrostatic wafer clamp. The concept has been proven, but has not yet been optimized.\n\nJob Description\n\nOptimize the electrostatic particle removal method for particle removal effectiveness and duration.\n\nYour tasks will include:\n? Getting acquainted with the current knowledge status and way of working at high tech experimental setups.\n? Designing a plan to test the impact of selected parameters.\n? Performing experiments in a cleanroom environment.\n? Reporting and presenting your findings to the ASML electrostatics competence group.\n? Assisting in further development by creating and/or testing additional optimization hypotheses.\n\nEducation\n\nYou are a bachelor student in Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Physics, or a related field and you have an affinity with the fields of electrostatics and material science. You are a critical thinker, and a focused and accurate experimenter.\n\nThis is an internship (graduation or apprentice) for 5 days a week with a duration of about 6 months.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we can only consider students (who are enrolled at a school during the whole internship period) for our internships and graduation assignments.\n\n\n2. Internship: Design exploration of the low pressure gas pump\nIntroduction\n\nThis is an internship assignment for a master'sstudent in Mechanical Engineering or Applied Physics, graduating in a field that's compatiblewith fluid dynamics.\n\nJob Mission\n\nASML is working hard to enable greener technology by enabling smaller and more energy efficient electronics. The latest generation of lithography machines use light in the extreme ultra violet range. Since light of this wavelength (13.5 nm) is absorbed by any optical medium, reflective optics in a vacuum are used. Any dust particle can potentially ruin the light patterns that are generated in the machines. Therefore, high velocity jets of low pressure gas are used to push contamination away from sensitive modules.\n\nThis requires relatively large flows (~100's of liters per minute) of clean hydrogen gas for particle and contamination suppression. This gas is currently burned off after it has passed through the system once, meaning that the lithography systems currently aren't very energy efficient. This assignment aims to find a way to at least partially recycle the hydrogen flow. For this we need systems to pump low pressure (~100 Pa) gas.\n\nJob Description\n\nThere are scaling laws that can be used to estimate the efficiency of fans and pumps at lower pressure. However, it is unclear if they hold at these low pressures. Therefore we need someone to design, validate and use a test set up to determine the efficiency of various pumps and fans.\n\nDeliverables\n?Evaluate which pumping systems could match the requirements.\n?Design a test setup to test the pumpingsystems in an existing vacuum vessel.\n?Test and validate the setup.\n?Determine if any of the pumping systems would suffice for our goals, and document your findings.\n\nYou'll be working in close collaboration with experienced architect(s) and designers to bring this project to a successful end.\n\nEducation\n\nYou are a master's student in Mechanical Engineering or Applied Physics, graduating in a field that's compatible with fluid dynamics. The study has both practical and theoretical aspects, where the focus will be is up to you.\nWe are looking for someone who asks questions and who is willing to pick up and incorporate new information quickly. We expect you to drive your own project and to prepare planning and test claims (under guidance by your supervisor).\n\nThis is an apprentice or graduation internship for 3-5 days a week with a minimum duration of 6 months. The start date can be discussed.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we can only consider students (who are enrolled at a school during the whole internship period) for our internships and graduation assignments.\n\nFurthermore, this position requires access to U.S. controlled technology, as defined in the United States Export Administration Regulations. Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such U.S. controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with applicants who are immediately eligible to access U.S. controlled technology.\n\n3. Internship: Quantify the precision of a GigE Time Synchronization method\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is an apprentice or graduation internship for Bachelor students in Electronics who would like to dive in the problem of how to derive time information from different available (clock) signals at both the master and the slave and how to measure it by means of automation using Python and a very state-of-the-art oscilloscope.\n\nJob Mission\n\nIn many industrial applications its required to have very precise time synchronization between different control nodes. The gigabit ethernet interface (GigE) between them allows to implement time-synchronization protocols like IEEE1588 which apply a two way time transfer method. Channel symmetry is key in such method as well as the local timestamp accuracy that determines the time moments used to come to time corrections at the slave.\nDemanding applications require high precision synchronization in the order of nanoseconds. For optical implementations this has shown to be feasible. For electrical implementation using copper 1000BASE-T only very limited research is available. A concept has been studied and prototyped using development boards that potentially would allow to achieve very accurate timings over copper interfaces as well.\n \n\nJob Description\nStudy in more depth a particular Gigabit Ethernet PHY;\nCreate a Python script that allows commanding an existing development kit having a gigE chip;\nExtend the Python script to allow controlling and reading measurements of a high-end oscilloscope;\nCreate an automated test environment that allows to measure the timing of Master and Slave in subnanosecond resolution;\nExecute multiple test with different cable length.\nDocument the measurement results and draw conclusions on the achievable precision.\n \nEducation\n\nYou are a HBO bachelor studying electrical engineering or a related discipline. You are eager to dive in the problem of how to derive time information from different available (clock) signals at both the master and the slave and how to measure it by means of automation using python and a very state-of-the-art oscilloscope.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we can only consider students (who are enrolled at a school during the whole internship period) for our internships and graduation assignments.\n\n \n\nOther information\n\nWhat ASML offers\nYour internship will be in one of the leading Dutch corporations, gaining valuable experience in a highly dynamic environment. You will receive a monthly internship allowance of 500 euro (maximum), plus a possible housing or travel allowance. In addition, you'll get expert, practical guidance and the chance to work in and experience a dynamic, innovative team environment.\n\nASML: Be part of progress\nWe make machines that make chips ? the hearts of the devices that keep us informed, entertained and safe; that improve our quality of life and help to tackle the world's toughest problems.\n\nWe build some of the most amazing machines that you will ever see, and the software to run them. Never satisfied, we measure our performance in units that begin with pico or nano.\n\nWe believe we can always do better. We believe the winning idea can come from anyone. We love what we do ? not because it's easy, but because it's hard.\n\nStudents: Getting ready for real-world R&D\nPushing technology further is teamwork, and our R&D team is more than 5,500 people strong, with major sites on three continents. Dozens of diverse, interdisciplinary teams work in parallel to meet a challenging development schedule.\n\nIn such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country, or even working for a different company.\n\nAn internship at ASML is your opportunity to get to know this world of industrial-strength R&D and get a feel for that excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?\n\nHow will you be part of progress?","Job Function":"Software Development","Wage Type":"Stipend","Wage (Minimum)":"582","Full Time / Part Time":"Full Time (32+ Hours Per Week)","Source College":"College of Engineering","Targeted Degrees and Disciplines":"View Targeted Programs","Application Deadline":"Jan 31, 2020 11:59:00 PM","Application Documents Required":"Resume","Application Method":"NUcareers","Organization":"ASML","Division":"Stichting ASML Foundation"},{"Do you intend to use the Automated Offer Tool for this position?":"No","Co-op Job Title":"Front End Web Developer Co-op","Job Type":"Co-op (US Domestic)","Openings":"1","Term":"2020 - Spring","Length":"6 Month","Region":"Massachusetts-Boston","City":"Boston","Province / State":"MA","Country":"United States","Job Level":"Intermediate to Advanced","Job Description":"We're hiring a Web Engineer Co-Op to learn about, build, and maintain innovative web applications for our global membership platform.

The extensive routine traffic volumes bring pressures to existing urban traffic infrastructure, resulting in everyday traffic congestions. Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) aims for reducing potential congestions in saturated road networks, by adjusting the signal timing according to real-time traffic dynamics.\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, and deep neural networks further enhance its learning power. However, centralized RL -that can be formulated under the \"classical\" framework of Markov decision process (MDP)- is infeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by distributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new challenges: now the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint of each local agent due to limited communication among agents.\n\nThe purpose of this task is to apply the most advanced techniques available in MARL to properly manage traffic controls in order to improve the traffic conditions in the city of Palermo.\n\nThe ideal candidate should have the following skills:\n-A basic knowledge of software's to simulate urban mobility (SUMO)\n-Good knowledge of Reinforcement Learning techniques\n-Some experience with Recurrent Neural Networks (ex.

In order to react to these changes it is necessary to develop a new less expensive production and consumption energy systems, able to reduce environmental impact and waste generation.\n\nThe need for a transition based on the use of renewables and low environmental impact technologies is particularly important in rural areas where the deterioration of environmental resources is an important issue; in such contexts the potentiality for improvements are very important, considering the existing low-productivity index especially in poorer areas.\n\nThis necessary transition can be achieved with better management of energy and natural resources, especially through the production of energy based on biomass and the residues of agricultural production. In fact, among the various sources of energy, the sustainable use of forestry origin biomass together with agriculture and animal waste are a very high energetic and technological potential resources. The benefits the use of bioenergy can provide cover not only the environment, but also the economic and social structure that benefits from a reduction in production costs and in waste disposal costs.\n\nThe research activities of the CNR-IIA bioenergies group are focused on the design and development of technologies with reduced environmental impact and on the transfer of knowledge to the rural world.\n\nIn detail, the group focuses its activities on:\nDevelopment of innovative prototypes for the energetic exploitation of the biomass\nDevelopment of innovative biogas purification systems\nEnvironmental analysis of production of energy from biomass with Life Cycle Assessment methodology (LCA)\nAnalysis of of environmental impacts connected to energy production\nArtificial Intelligence for environmental application\nMajors considered:\nEngineering\nMathematics\nSome projects (www.isaac-project.it, www.biogame.it, www.essiccatoremobile.it, www.smartisland.it )\nIndustry: CNR IIA  (National Research Council, Institute on Atmospheric Pollution Research)\n ","Job Function":"Engineering","Wage Type":"Unpaid","Wage (Minimum)":"0","Full Time / Part Time":"Full Time (32+ Hours Per Week)","Source College":"College of Engineering","Job Manager":"Sally Conant","Targeted Degrees and Disciplines":"View Targeted Programs","Application Deadline":"Jan 31, 2020 11:59:00 PM","Application Documents Required":"Resume","Application Method":"NUcareers","Organization":"National Research Council of Italy","Division":"Institute of Atmospheric Pollution Research","Website":"www.iia.cnr.it"},{"Do you intend to use the Automated Offer Tool for this position?":"No","Co-op Job Title":"Writer Co-Op (Toronto)","Job Type":"Co-op (Global)","Openings":"2","Term":"2020 - Spring","Length":"6 Month","Region":"Global - Americas","City":"Toronto","Province / State":"ON","Country":"Canada","Job Level":"Suited to All Levels","Job Description":"**Term is flexible, can be Fall 2019 or Spring 2020**\n\nNetbrain Technologies is seeking outstanding students aspiring to become technical writers to work in a hands-on, paid internship.

This is an emerging area of research with the potential to be a game-changing approach to dealing with the challenge of software verification. Society is crucially dependent on software, which is used to control critical infrastructure, medical devices, power plants, trains, automobiles, planes, stock markets and sensitive data such as medical and financial records. Bugs in software have lead to deaths, the loss of massive amounts of money and numerous security vulnerabilities. Traditionally software verification requires highly trained formal methods experts and our goal is to develop engaging games that allow non-experts to reason about software.\n\nThe current state of the art only allows players to come up with program invariants for very simple programs; we want players to come up with invariants for more complex programs. More generally, we want to develop a game that provides counterexamples, allows multiple players to work together, and allows players more specialized roles and has support for hierarchy and decomposing problems into smaller, more manageable components.\n\nOne major assumption that most existing games have made in that code should be hidden from players. Recent work from our group has questioned this assumption, and we developed a game, IDG, that does show players code. Our experimental evaluation shows that players of IDG discover higher quality invariants that prove more programs correct than players of previous games. Our game supports richer human-computer interactions, leading to effective human-in-the-loop systems that are able to augment the ability of non-experts to find loop invariants. See below for a link to the paper.\n\nFor this project, we want to explore the following interesting question: how far we can get without showing code (for example, by showing execution traces and counterexamples), which may be a balanced approach that is both effective and engaging to players. Part of the motivation comes from our experience with IDG; while the game is a significant improvement over previous approaches, the attrition rate in the population that played it was higher than trace-based games. So, a natural question is whether we can take the lessons learned and the technology we developed to design a more engaging game.\n\nWe are using ACL2s (covered in CS2800) and JavaScript to develop a web game. We expect that working on the project will involve work on web game development, systems programming in ACL2s/Lisp, Linux server development and databases, running experiments, analyzing data, and writing a report for publication.\n\nYou can try the game here: http://invgame.atwalter.com/.\n\nYou can read the paper comparing the code and no-code versions of the game here: Gamification of Loop-Invariant Discovery from Code.\n ","Job Function":"Software Development","Wage Type":"Hourly","Wage (Minimum)":"16.00","Full Time / Part Time":"Full Time (32+ Hours Per Week)","Source College":"Coll of Computer & Info Sci","Targeted Degrees and Disciplines":"View Targeted Programs","Application Deadline":"Jan 31, 2020 11:59:00 PM","Application Documents Required":"Resume","Application Method":"NUcareers","Organization":"Northeastern University","Division":"Khoury College of Computer Sciences"},{"Do you intend to use the Automated Offer Tool for this position?":"No","Co-op Job Title":"Research Assistant Co-op","Job Type":"Co-op (US Domestic)","Openings":"1","Term":"2020 - Spring","Length":"4 Month","Region":"Massachusetts-Boston","City":"Boston","Province / State":"MA","Country":"United States","Job Level":"Suited to All Levels","Job Description":"We are looking for students for the Spring/Summer 1 semester to work as a co-op on an educational game development project called May's Journey.

This is not easy and is thus one of the main skills you will further develop during your stay. In addition, the collaboration requires (and will further develop) strong communication stills. As you responsibly manage your own project, you are also the advocate of it and thus, you need to ask for help, feedback, remind people of deadlines, etc. This is particularly relevant in international teams as people from different backgrounds communicate differently. During the internship, you will also get involved in our teaching activities. The goal of the internship is to write a scientific article about the project (that may get published in a scientific journal). Also, you will get a firsthand impression in the work as a PhD student.\n \nHours per week: 35-40 hr/week, about 10 paid vacation days for 6 month\nSalary/ Stipend: about 600 EUR (around 650 USD) per month (additional scholarships possible).\nMajors considered: Chemical Engineering, Computer Engineering/Computer Science, Mathematics or another related field\nLanguage Requirements: You are able to work and communicate in English. Other languages (in particular German) are an asset but not required.\n ","Job Function":"Engineering","Wage Type":"Stipend","Wage (Minimum)":"650","Full Time / Part Time":"Full Time (32+ Hours Per Week)","Source College":"College of Engineering","Job Manager":"Sally Conant","Targeted Degrees and Disciplines":"View Targeted Programs","Application Deadline":"Jan 31, 2020 11:59:00 PM","Application Documents Required":"Resume","Application Method":"NUcareers","Organization":"RWTH Aachen University (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule)","Division":"RWTH Aachen University (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule)"},{"Do you intend to use the Automated Offer Tool for this position?":"No","Co-op Job Title":"Mobile Developer","Job Type":"Co-op (US Domestic)","Openings":"1","Term":"2020 - Spring","Length":"6 Month","Region":"Massachusetts-Boston","City":"Boston","Province / State":"MA","Country":"United States","Job Level":"Intermediate","Job Description":"Mobile Developer\n\nWe are Rue Technology, the team responsible for all the technology behind ruelala.com.

Sikubora was founded by a Northeastern Alumni in 2013 and has installed solar home systems for hundreds off grid Tanzanians in a country where over 40 million people lack access to electricity. Sikubora also installs large customized solar energy systems for schools, hospitals, lodges and other businesses. Installations can include solar panels, wiring, lighting, tv's,  phone chargers, and water pumping and heating systems. Sikubora employs around 20 people, most of whom are locals from Arusha.\n\nCo-op Job Description:\n\nSikubora is a small company so students will have the opportunity to contribute to many aspects of the business. Co-ops will have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects at Sikubora such as:\n \nERP and Website Development:\nCo-ops will have the opportunity to develop the enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is used by employees to store customer information, manage ongoing projects, and to track revenue and expenses. There are also opportunities to develop the customer facing website. Co-ops will learn skills in database and website design using SQL, PHP, HTML and JavaScript.\n \nSystem Design:\nCo-ops will have the opportunity to assist in the design, cost analysis and installation of solar projects. Sikubora deploys systems consisting of solar panels, charge controllers, lighting, inverters, water pumping/heaters and electric appliances.\n \nFinancial Model Development:\nThere will be opportunities to develop a financial model for the company. We need a reliable way to predict and measure the cost and revenue from each project as well as for the company as a whole.\n \nCo-ops will also have the opportunity to become immersed in Tanzanian culture. Students will have up to 3 weeks time off to explore everything that the country has to offer. Past co-ops have used this time to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, go on safari in the Serengeti, and travel to nearby African countries.\n \nSkills Gained by the End of Co-op/Internship:\nSQL, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, System Design, Power Analysis.\n\nBenefits:\nYou will be paid $300 per month (exchange rates fluctuate based on current market but this number is represented in approximate USD). This will cover most if not all of your living expenses and is the rate that full-time newly graduated engineers are paid in Tanzania.\n \nCo-ops will also have the opportunity to become immersed in Tanzanian culture. Students will have up to 3 weeks time off to explore everything that the country has to offer. Past co-ops have used this time to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, go on safari in the Serengeti, and travel to nearby African countries.\n\nIf you have a phone with an unlockable sim card, bring it. Phones don't work on plans like most do in the USA, but rather on a pay-as-you-go system for texting, calling, and data. You can likely find living arrangements, especially with a roommate, for around $200/month per person. You should also be prepared to purchase a tourist visa upon your arrival and then a work permit. If you have a computer, please bring it, as we offer wifi at work.\n\nSikubora is located in northern Tanzania just outside of Arusha. Arusha is one of Tanzania's largest cities and is very popular with tourist traveling to Mount Kilimanjaro and the national parks for safaris. The national language of Tanzania is Swahili, but English speakers are not uncommon, and English is spoken in the office. Tanzania has a very peaceful culture with a low cost of living. For public transportation, a bus ride from town to the office is under 25 cents.\n\nFormer co-op says:\n\"This opportunity at Sikubora gave me a lot of responsibility. Although it is a small company, it is a big thing to be given the tasks and duties such as talking to investors, remote monitoring..etc. Also being involved in some of the meetings with the technicians was nice. Those meetings and the opportunities to go on installation helped me understand the company and the climate Sikubora was acting in. The projects were interesting and versatile. I really enjoyed the array of knowledge I received from completing projects in finance, computer science and business.\"\n\nAround Arusha there are many delicious food options, including a variety of locally grown fruits and vegetables. At the market, you can buy produce and goods for an entire week at a very reasonable price. In general, items bought frequently cost less in Tanzania than in the United States, with the exception of quality electronics and some other specially manufactured goods. There are also plenty of good restaurants and bars around Arusha. A lunch at the restaurant near Sikubora's office might cost between $1 and $3, while local beer is sold at around $2 per half-liter bottle.\n\nGetting around town is also inexpensive. Most people use the \"daladala\", which is a van with seats for 15 people, though more will squeeze in and stand. The daladala goes almost everywhere around town (including to Sikubora in Kisongo) and generally costs around 20 cents per ride. Cars are also used to some degree, and motorcycles excessively. In and around town, there are plenty of activities. You can go shopping in the markets, play sports with local groups, and enjoy a variety of traditions. There are scores of natural and cultural wonders near and outside town, such as waterfalls, reservations, and tribal villages.\n\nAt the office, there are many Tanzanians who can help you adapt to life in Arusha. Overall, this part of East Africa is safe, will receive you with open arms, and offers a life-changing experience.","Job Function":"Engineering","Wage Type":"Stipend","Wage (Minimum)":"300","Full Time / Part Time":"Full Time (32+ Hours Per Week)","Source College":"College of Engineering","Targeted Degrees and Disciplines":"View Targeted Programs","Application Deadline":"Jan 31, 2020 11:59:00 PM","Application Documents Required":"Resume","Application Method":"NUcareers","Organization":"Sikubora Ltd","Division":"Sikubora Ltd","Website":"http://www.sikubora.com/"},{"Do you intend to use the Automated Offer Tool for this position?":"Yes","Co-op Job Title":"Software Development","Job Type":"Co-op (US Domestic)","Openings":"1","Term":"2020 - Spring","Length":"6 Month","Region":"Massachusetts-Boston","City":"Boston","Province / State":"MA","Country":"United States","Job Level":"Suited to All Levels","Job Description":"\n### Job Title\nSoftware Development Coop\n\n### Position and Company Overview\n\nSmartleaf was founded to improve the way money is managed for the majority of people.\nEveryone wants their money to be managed well but the quality of financial advice available today can be inconsistent and attention from a financial advisor is directly proportional to the amount of money an investor already has.\n\nSmartleaf is about bringing consistency and scale to the investment process so that good advice can be delivered to everyone.

Students attend this informational meeting to learn more about COE global co-op, and following your resume can be forwarded to COE global employers.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\n\nAre you interested in real-world solutions to pressing global issues such as climate change, food security, and environmental justice? Do you crave experiences outside the norm that push you to think differently? Are you ready to become a part of something bigger? If so, join us at VerdEnergia Pacifica, a multicultural permaculture community and agroforestry project in the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest, on your next co-op! This co-op position takes students out of the theoretics of the classroom and puts them into hands-on learning scenarios that incorporate principles of permaculture, agroforestry, and regenerative economics. Together, we are envisioning a brighter, greener future, and we invite you to be a part of it.\n\nVerdEnergia was founded in 2006 by a small group of initial investors with the intention of building a cooperative farm in order to secure a healthy future for ourselves and our families.  A green oasis situated in one of the most heavily deforested parts of Costa Rica, the Verde team has worked hard over the years to reforest while simultaneously developing the land into a food forest that could sustain our community. Since then, we have transformed into an education center where people from all over the globe can come to exchange ideas, experience living in an intentional community, and learn about agroforestry and permaculture in a place that is creating a community-based, regenerative economic model with permaculture principles acting as our guide and unifying tool. We combine theory with applied practice, enabling ourselves and others to find right livelihood through practicing permaculture. Our humble project has since expanded into the founding of another business focused on reforesting our watershed, Blacksheep Regenerative Resource Management (https://www.weareblacksheep.org/). Our co-op offers the opportunity for students to work with this budding international business, with the potential for further education, internships, and even employment opportunities. \n\nThis co-op is for those interested in experiencing theory in action, living in a community, and engaging with sustainability projects in a hands-on and dynamic environment. Students will work closely throughout the program with our on-site permaculture experts and support staff on projects ranging from natural building and construction to planting, harvesting, reforestation, hospitality and more. In addition to daily chores expected of every intern, co-op students in the Content Journalism Program have a concentration on documenting daily life of farm staff and interns, the surrounding jungle and its wildlife, agroforestry initiatives, and more through their writing and other modes of creation. These students will be expected to create written content for the VerdEnergia blog, with the potential to work on other projects that require writing and editing expertise. These students will have the opportunity to work with a professional writing staff. Other opportunities may include social media marketing, content editing, or business and legal writing. This experience can be shaped by the interests of the student, but with prompts, guidance, feedback and quotas given by farm marketing staff. Journalism, Marketing, or Writing students can learn about content creation and apply it to an active business model, gain professional writing experience, and are expected to put together a portfolio of their work at the end of their stay. This is a unique position that is truly crafted and flavored by each individual student. Because of this, the ideal candidate for this opportunity is self-motivated, interested, open-minded, creative and responsible.\n\nNot only do students participate in experiential learning opportunities throughout the course of their co-op by working with Steve, they will also be formally trained in permaculture design while studying under other permaculture and agroforestry experts through the permaculture design course. The permaculture design course, or PDC, is a 21-day intensive immersion course exploring the theories outlined in Bill Mollison's Permaculture: A Designer's Manual in both hands-on and classroom settings. The curriculum covers regenerative practices as well as design theory and the basics of design consultation on a professional level. Our well-rounded permaculture courses cover the many facets of permaculture and focus on practical solutions in agriculture, building and design, economics, social sciences and politics. Additionally, students will engage with other participants and community members from all over the globe, and will have the opportunity to learn about other projects going on both in Costa Rica, the United States, and beyond.\n\nFor a co-op intern, daily life at VerdEnergia is dynamic and dependent on the season. Please keep in mind that experiences vary due to season and length of stay.\n\nOur co-op program is 6 months long total, with 5 months onsite and 1 month of remote work you can do anywhere with an internet connection.\n\nSPRING SEMESTER\nJan 6 - June 25th, 2020 (total program - remote and onsite)\nJan 14 - June 2, 2020 (onsite portion of program)\nDuring the Spring semester, seasons shift from dry season to growing season. Students will get to participate in VerdEnergia's shift of focus from hospitality, harvesting and construction to planting, pruning and field maintenance.\n\nSUMMER/FALL SEMESTER\nJuly 1 - December 23, 2020 (total program - remote and onsite)\nJuly 14 - December 1, 2020 (onsite portion of program)\nThe Summer/Fall semester is a time of quiet abundance. Seasons shift from veranito (\"Little summer\") to full-on rainy season in September and October. Expect peaceful rain, tree planting, garden nurturing, field maintenance and pruning, construction, and harvesting our year's work.\n\nOf course, there is some crossover of work between the seasons; these descriptions give a general idea to help you plan your visit. Food processing, hospitality, and maintenance are a part of community living at VerdEnergia.  Please be prepared to engage in wherever the community needs help.\n\nDuring time off you can go for a swim in our river, pool, or waterfall, walk jungle trails, enjoy the views from one of our beautiful vistas, do yoga or dance in our studio, make art, play music, check out a local soccer game, or simply relax in a hammock with a good book from our community library.\n\nCommunal living is integral to our daily operations. Participants should be comfortable living and working together as well as contributing to farm upkeep. As a community, we wake up together, eat meals together, take turns cooking and cleaning up, and share in the responsibilities of keeping daily operations running smoothly. Each member of farm staff has a different job and responsibilities, but we all do our best to work together as a cohesive group.\n\nWhile on co-op at VerdEnergia, students will be living on the farm full-time and thus do not need to search for housing or transportation for the duration of the program. As students live, eat, and work on the farm, we ask them to pay for their cost of living.The price is $5600 per semester. This money goes towards the students' certification in permaculture course, food, housing, water and electricity bills, facilities maintenance, and to pay our staff that help make this opportunity possible. We are happy to discuss any questions regarding our pricing model.\n\nIf interested in this opportunity, please read more about our project on our website, https://www.verdenergia.org/.

In addition to general co-op activities, students of a range of majors and focuses can bring their talents and passions to this position. In the past, engineering students have collected data for our future micro-hydro project; Biology and Environmental Studies students have assisted in long-term soil studies; Policy and law students gain insight into alternative ways of tackling contemporary issues; Students with marketing skills have helped build our social media presence; Students of a business background will receive insight into the back-of-house inner workings of a developing international business. This is a unique position that is truly crafted and flavored by each individual student. Because of this, the ideal candidate for this opportunity is self-motivated, interested, open-minded, and responsible.\n\nNot only do students participate in experiential learning opportunities throughout the course of their co-op, they will also be formally trained and certified in permaculture design while studying under other permaculture and agroforestry experts through the permaculture design course. Scheduled at the beginning of the internship semester, the permaculture design course, or PDC, is a 21-day intensive immersion course exploring the theories outlined in Bill Mollison's Permaculture: A Designer's Manual in both hands-on and classroom settings. The curriculum covers regenerative practices as well as design theory and the basics of design consultation on a professional level. Our well-rounded permaculture courses cover the many facets of permaculture and focus on scientific, practical solutions in agriculture, building and design, economics, social sciences, and politics. Additionally, students will engage with other participants and community members from all over the globe and will have the opportunity to learn about other projects going on both in Costa Rica, the United States, and beyond. \n\nOur co-op program is 6 months long total, with 5 months onsite and 1 month of remote work you can do anywhere with an internet connection.\n\nFor a co-op intern, daily life at VerdEnergia is dynamic and dependent on the season. Please keep in mind that experiences vary due to season and length of stay. \n\nSPRING SEMESTER\nJan 6 - June 25th, 2020 (total program - remote and onsite)\nJan 14 - June 2, 2020 (onsite portion of program)\nDuring the Spring semester, seasons shift from dry season to growing season. Students will get to participate in VerdEnergia's shift of focus from hospitality, harvesting and construction to planting, pruning and field maintenance. \n\nSUMMER/FALL SEMESTER\nJuly 1 - December 23, 2020 (total program - remote and onsite)\nJuly 14 - December 1, 2020 (onsite portion of program)\nThe Summer/Fall semester is a time of quiet abundance. Seasons shift from veranito (\"Little summer\") to full-on rainy season in September and October. Expect peaceful rain, tree planting, garden nurturing, field maintenance and pruning, construction, and harvesting our year's work. \n\nOf course, there is some crossover of work between the seasons; these descriptions give a general idea to help you plan your visit. Both of our internship semesters begin with the Permaculture Design Course and then expand into a practical application period. Food processing, hospitality, and maintenance are a part of community living at VerdEnergia. Please be prepared to engage in wherever the community needs help. \n\nDuring time off you can go for a swim in our river, pool, or waterfall, walk jungle trails, enjoy the views from one of our beautiful vistas, do yoga or dance in our studio, make art, play music, check out a local soccer game, or simply relax in a hammock with a good book from our community library.\nCommunal living is integral to our daily operations. Therefore, personal accountability and good roommate skills are a must. Participants should be comfortable living and working together as well as contributing to farm upkeep. As a community, we wake up together, eat meals together, take turns cooking and cleaning up, and share in the responsibilities of keeping daily operations running smoothly. Each member of farm staff has a different job and responsibilities, but we all do our best to work together as a cohesive group. \nWhile on co-op at VerdEnergia, students will be living on the farm full-time and thus do not need to search for housing or transportation for the duration of the program. As students live, eat, and work on the farm, we ask them to pay for their cost of living. The price is $5600 per semester. This money goes towards the students' certification in permaculture, their food and housing, water and electricity bills, facilities maintenance, and to pay our staff that help make this opportunity possible. We are happy to discuss any questions regarding our pricing model. \n\nIf interested in this opportunity, please read more about our project on our website, https://www.verdenergia.org/. Apply to this position through NUcareers and we schedule an interview. We hope to see you soon!
